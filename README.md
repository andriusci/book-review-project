    ## Description
The Best Reads project is focused around the people who are looking for the books via the Internet. The project aims to help people making crowdsource-based decisions about their next good read and attempts to help the owner making a few bucks. Therefore, it takes shape of a database backed website that not only allows the users to search, rate, recommend and review books, but also enables the site owner to participate in the Amazon’s affiliate program.

## UX
In order to build good UX it is necessary to identify business goals and to determine user needs. Therefore, this section gives an insight into the aforementioned aspects, which in turn helps to specify features for this project.

#### Business goals
* increase business value by allowing the owner to earn money via an affiliate program.
* ncrease earning potential by encouraging the users to upload more books.

#### User needs
As a book hunter, I would like to:
* be able to search for the books.
* find the information about the books such as the book format.
* know what other people think about the particular book.
* be able to buy a book directly from the site or be redirected to an e-shop via a link from the site.

As a user who read a particular book and found it on the site, I would like to:
* let others know about my opinion regarding the book.
* know what others think about the book.

As a user who read a particular book, searched for it and did not find it on the website, I would like to:
* share the book with others and let others know what I think about the book.
